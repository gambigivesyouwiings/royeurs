             <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Discover Our Purpose</p>
        </div>
           <h4>Why we do what we do</h4>
        <p>For years we have been editing the online encyclopedia as good faith volunteers. The realization that Wikipedia was the most powerful reference tool in the internet had not only dawned on us but on top corporations as well.</p>
           <p>
             We noticed many companies using employees to edit or create their Wikipedia pages despite the employees having limited knowledge about how the encyclopedia works. It was then that we noticed how the Wikipedia community generally treats editors with a conflict of interest who try and do things the right way. They would request changes to be made to the articles but their efforts would go unanswered for months on end before anyone listened to them. Some have tried editing without following the set regulations and have had their articles tagged as promotional or as edited for undisclosed payments. PR firms have tried this as well but most efforts usually end badly from our experience. Some have tried creating articles with little success failing to get past the draft stage and getting approval to be moved to the main space. In most times it wasn't down to the subject of the article being non-notable but down to the stigma that someone with a relation to the subject has attempted to create the article.
           </p>
           <p>It was then that Wiki Royale was born. Basically our main goal was to solve the problem between the two sides, while benefiting both parties; expanding the encyclopedia as well as helping our clients establish their Wikipedia presence.</p>
           <p>In order to maintain trust between the Wikipedia community and our clients, we adhere to Wikipedia regulations. That means we only work with notable clients and the edits we make are not promotional in any way but purely neutral and unbiased.</p>

            <h4>What sets us out from the rest</h4>
          <p>Now the next thing we saw upon further research was that there were other agencies already offering the same services as us. However, there were very few who weren't a scam, and even fewer who offered the service while maintaining transparency to their clients. For Nesh it was this that really prompted the creation of Wiki Royale. A service based platform where clients can trust and get quality results to their satisfaction. We build cordial relationships with our clients and only take payments after completion of the project to ensure that we maintain a high level of trust.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2">
              <p>Before working with any client, we first establish your notability. That means we check whether you have received significant coverage, usually at least three (if we contacted you first, most likely you are notable). We then go over the specifics of the project. Mostly this is through virtual meetings with Nesh himself but for some clients we accept going through them via mail. Afterwards we start the project and work on it till completion. We provide updates regularly to you about the progress of the project. Upon completion, we ask you to inspect it yourself to confirm everything is as you expected. It is only until then that you pay for the project.</p>
              <p>However, we don't work with all clients. In order to conform by Wikipedia's rules we only work with notable clients. That means clients that have received significant, widespread and independent coverage. We don't fabricate articles so as to make our clients notable as this goes contrary to the Wikipedia regulations.</p>
